# definity: an open-source web front-end for Enterprise Architect

Definity aims to be an front-end for Enterprise Architect, allowing users to create, read, update and delete model elements in an (mySQL/MariaDB-based) Enterprise Architect repository. It's targeted users are systems engineers that have limited of no knowledge of SysML. Definity does not use the Enterprise Architect application, instead it will perform operations on the underlying database, and uses the semantics of SysML 1.x ( and 2.x in the future).

##  Definity does **not** try to mimic the functionality of EA. It is not an open source replacement for EA. 

What can it do (eventually...)?
1. Create, Read, update and Delete requirements
2. Create, Read, update and Delete testcases
3. Define simple function hierarchies
4. Define simple system hierarchies
5. Maintain interfaces, function & requirement allocations through Design Structure Matrices (simple + multi-domain)
6. Express dynamic properties (information, material, energy) or static properties (force, space) exchanged on interfaces
7. Maintain relations between requirements, testcases, functions and systems
8. Generation of reports and documents
