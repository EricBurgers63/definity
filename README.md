# definity: an open-source web front-end for Enterprise Architect

Definity aims to be an front-end for Enterprise Architect, allowing users to create, read, update and delete model elements in an (mySQL/MariaDB-based) Enterprise Architect repository. It's targetted users are systems engineers that have limited of no knowledge of SysML. Definity does not use the Enterprise Architect application, instead it will perform operations on the underlying database.


##  Definity does **not** try to mimic the functionality of EA. It is not an open source replacement for EA.
